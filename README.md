🌾 Crop Recommendation System
A machine learning–based system that suggests the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental and soil conditions such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

It uses a Random Forest Classifier to learn from historical agricultural data and provide crop recommendations with high accuracy.

📌 Problem Statement
Farmers often face difficulty choosing the right crop for their land due to varying soil and weather conditions. This system aims to assist by recommending crops based on scientific patterns and historical data, helping farmers make informed decisions.

✅ Features
📥 Accepts real-world environmental and agricultural data.

🤖 Trains a machine learning model to understand crop suitability.

🌱 Recommends the optimal crop using classification techniques.

📊 Evaluates model using accuracy and classification metrics.

🔧 Easy to extend with new algorithms or live data sources.

🧠 Algorithms Used
Random Forest Classifier (from scikit-learn)

Why Random Forest?

Handles nonlinear and complex relationships

Prevents overfitting

Delivers high accuracy

You can also try other models like:

🌳 Decision Tree

📌 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

📈 Support Vector Machine (SVM)

📊 Dataset Information
Format: CSV

Source: Crop Recommendation Dataset (Kaggle or similar)

Size: ~4,000+ samples

Column	Description
N	Nitrogen level in soil
P	Phosphorus level in soil
K	Potassium level in soil
temperature	Temperature in °C
humidity	Humidity in %
ph	Soil pH value
rainfall	Rainfall in mm
label	Recommended crop (target)

📁 Place the dataset inside a folder named crop_dataset before running the notebook.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

pandas

seaborn & matplotlib (for data visualization)

scikit-learn (for machine learning)

🚀 How to Run This Project
Upload your dataset ZIP file to Google Colab.

Extract it. Make sure the CSV file is placed inside a folder named crop_dataset.

Run the notebook step-by-step:

Load and explore the dataset

Visualize feature correlation

Split data into train/test

Train the Random Forest Classifier

Evaluate the model using test data

(Optional) Make predictions using:
model.predict([[N, P, K, temp, humidity, pH, rainfall]])

📈 Sample Output
Model Accuracy: 97–99% (varies by dataset)

Classification report with:

Precision

Recall

F1-score for each crop

☁️ Integrate real-time weather APIs

🌾 Support multiple crop recommendations per region
